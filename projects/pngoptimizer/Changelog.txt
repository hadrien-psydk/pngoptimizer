-----------------
2006-01-09 (1.5.4 aka 1.54)

- uneeded bKGD chunk inserted when the "Keep background color" option was set.

-----------------
2006-01-07 (1.5.3 aka 1.53)

- Use of critical section to avoid potential conflict between the user interface and the working thread.
- Corrected 24 bits & 32 bits BMP decoding errors.
- Support for 16 bits BMPs.
- "Clear" option in the context menu to clear the list.
- Better previous window positionning :
   - When PngOptimizer was minimized then closed, the window was unreachable at relaunch.
   - When other instances of PngOptimizer are running, the window is now offseted respectively to the previous
     instance window.

-----------------
2005-11-20 (1.5.2 aka 1.52)

- Use of the latest zlib (v1.2.3 ; 2005-07-18) instead of the zlib++ based on v1.1.4
- Further compression for 24 bits images :

  Checking size without filtering : slower optimization but improves file size (no more +50% increase)

- Further compression for 32 bits images :

   Checking size without filtering (same method than for 24 bits images).

   A 32 bits image which could be converted to a 24 bits image was then stored to the disk.
   Now PngOptimizer feeds the 24 bits image to the 24 bits optimizer (which can lead to a palette image).

- Improved general compression by changing the ZLib compression strategy :

   Filtered images are stored with the Z_FILTERED strategy, otherwise Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY is used.

   For 32 bits images, both strategy are used and compared, as Z_FILTERED does not always give
   the best results for 32 bits filtered pictures.

- Warning when converting animated GIF

2005-08-15 (1.5.1 aka 1.51)

- BMP decoder crash with 32 bits BMPs
- Crashed when a fake bitmap was stored in the clipboard :
  IsClipboardFormatAvailable(CF_BITMAP) returned true, GetClipboardData(CF_BITMAP) returned NULL
  Case found when copying & pasting MSN Messenger smileys

-----------------
2005-03-11 (1.5)

- Full Unicode support (except for PngOptimizerCL).
- Corrected two memory leaks when decoding BMP and GIF files.
- Added an option to keep the background color (bKGD). Please note that the background color is
  not kept with indexed (palette mode) pictures. This option only works with true-color or grey
  pictures.
- PngOptimizer remembers the last window position and size.
- The main text window has been enhanced. Printing is faster in some cases. You can now scroll
  inside with the keyboard and the mouse wheel. The scrolling position is not lost anymore when
  you resize the window.
- For the first time in PngOptimizer history, introducing multithreading :) You can now move
  the interface while PngOptimizer is working.
- Support for compressed BMP added.
- Support for bitmap stored in the clipboard. Primary used for screenshots, but can be used
  for any bitmap stored in the clipboard.

  .:: More Info

  1) Take a screenshot with the "Print Screen" key or Alt+"Print Screen" for the current window only.
  2) Press Ctrl+V or Shift+Insert in the PngOptimizer window, or right-click in PngOptimizer and
     choose "Paste screenshot"
  3) PngOptimizer creates a PNG file from your screenshot, and prints the filename in its window.
  4) You can drag the file name out of the PngOptimizer window in any application which accepts
     dragged files.
  5) You can also double-click on the file name to display your picture in your favorite picture
     viewer.

  By default, those files are stored in your Temp directory in your Windows profile. For example :

  C:\Documents and Settings\YourName\Local Settings\Temp

  In Windows 98, the default storage location is located in the global Temp directory. For example :

  C:\WINDOWS\TEMP

  You can change the storage location : Right click in PngOptimizer and
  select "Change screenshots directory". A dialog box will allow you to select
  the screenshots location.

  You can view the content of the screenshots directory by right-clicking in the PngOptimizer window
  and choose "Show screenshots directory".

  Those PNG files are compressed with a medium ratio (zlib compression 6), in order to reduce
  the creation time. If you want to reduce the size a bit more, you can drag them from a file
  explorer to the PngOptimizer window.

  .:: Even More Info

  About dragging operations.

  The dragging result can be either a move or a copy of the screenshot file.

  The dragging behaviour is the same you are used to in Windows. For example, if you drag the file out
  of PngOptimizer to a file manager window, in the same partition than the screenshot directory, this
  will result in a move.

  To force a copy, press the Control key during the dragging.
  To force a move, press the Shift key during the dragging.

  As usual in Windows, the mouse cursor will show a "+" symbol if the dragging will result in a copy.
  No "+" appears if the dragging will result in a move.

  If the result of the dragging is a move, the link in the PngOptimizer is disabled, and its
  color changes.

- Support for command line filenames.

  .:: More Info

  It means you can select several files in the file explorer and drag them to the PngOptimizer
  executable file. You can also create a PngOptimizer shortcut into your � SendTo � folder. Then you
  select several files in the file explorer and send them to PngOptimizer.

- A new icon provided by Guillaume Schaeffer.

-----------------
2004-07-12 (1.4)
- Unicode support (for filenames and the log window).

  .:: More Info

  PngOptimizer uses the same font than the file explorer. To display correctly Unicode strings in both
  Windows and PngOptimizer, set the icon font to a complete unicode font, such as "Arial Unicode MS".

  Note that Windows 95/98/Me do not support Unicode filenames, so I had to add compatibility routines
  to deal with ANSI strings instead.

- A new icon :)
- Stability improvement when loading corrupted GIFs.
- Support for 32 bits BMPs.
- Better management of grayscale mode PNGs.
- New compression strategy. PngOptimizer now also checks compression with the palette sorted
  according to the number of color occurrences. It also checks the compression result with
  and without adaptive filtering. The optimization can be now a little more slower but the
  compression should be better.

  .:: More Info

  Adaptive filtering is a way of reordering byte values in PNGs in order to improve
  the compression. But sometimes the compression library performs better without
  this reordering.

- I also created a Command Line version of PngOptimizer. It's called PngOptimizerCL. Here are
  the arguments :

  For one file :

	PngOptimizerCL -file:"my file cool picture.png"

  You can use wildcards to specify several files at once :

	PngOptimizerCL -file:"Some Folder/*.png"

  The options have the same meanings than the GUI version. Here you are :
	-BackupOldPngFiles
	-KeepInterlacing
	-AvoidGreyWithSimpleTransparency

  Example :
	PngOptimizerCL -file:"my-logo.png" -KeepInterlacing -BackupOldPngFiles

  Note : the options set in the GUI version DO NOT impact on the Command Line version. This
         behaviour is by design.

  Note : you will get some information if you call PngOptimizerCL without any parameter.


-----------------
2003-12-04 (1.3.2)
- Public release with the MMX bug correction.

-----------------
2003-12-03 (1.3.1)
- Private release for F. Constantineau. Corrected a crash on CPUs without MMX support.

-----------------
2003-11-12 (1.3)
- Added support for interlaced PNG files.
- Added an option to keep or remove interlacing for interlaced PNG files.
- New compression strategies.

 .:: More Info

  For palettized images, the palette is now sorted according to color luminances.
  This sometimes increases compression, like for fadings. In some cases this could decrease
  compression of some bytes in comparison with the older version.

  In some cases, PngOptimizer will now perform the conversion with several parameters
  to get the best compression method. This may slow down the optimization in somes cases
  but will lead to better results.


-----------------
2003-03-21 (1.2)
- Gif transparency was not correctly detected when color 0 was used for transparency
- Optimization for 32 bits png :
	* if all alpha values are 100%, the alpha channel is discarded
	* if all alpha values are 100%, but one color has an alpha of 0%, the alpha channel is
	  discarded and the image is saved as RGB + simple transparency
- Optimization for 24 bits images :
	* if 256 or less different colors are used in the image, and if the image is big enough,
	the image is converted to palette mode.
	The image is declared big enough if (pixelcount * 3) >= (pixelcount + colcount * 3 + 12).
	Example : an image of 256 pixels with 256 different colors is kept in 24 bits.


-----------------
2002-08-27 (1.1)
- Improved support for black & white pictures
- The settings are now read and stored in the registry
- Added new option : "Avoid grey + simple transparency (IE Bug)"

  .:: Explanation :

  Internet Explorer does not support greyscaled images with simple transparency, but it supports
  palettized images with simple transparency. This option tells PngOptimizer to avoid conversion
  from palettized images into greyscale ones if simple transparency is used.

  .:: More Info :

  * for greyscale images, simple transparency means one grey index has an alpha value of 0%
    (completely transparent), while the other indexes have an alpha of 100% (fully opaque).
  * for palettized images, it means that for each palette entry an alpha value is assigned.
  * for true color images it means one color value has an alpha of 0%, while the others have an
    alpha of 100%.

  .:: Even More Info :

  Simple transparency is managed through a PNG chunk called tRNS
