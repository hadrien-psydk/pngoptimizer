Run pngoptimizercl with no argument to display the usage.

== About KeepBackgroundColor option ==

By default, PngOptimizerCL will remove any background color information found in a PNG (bkGD chunk).
If the option is provided, the background color information will be kept.

KeepBackgroundColor can also receive an argument:

- Use KeepBackgroundColor:R (or 0) to remove any background color information (same as no KeepBackgroundColor option)
- Use KeepBackgroundColor:K (or 1) to keep background color information if present (default argument)
- Use KeepBackgroundColor:F (or 2) to force a background color. The color is specificed with
  the BkColor option and a color in hexadecimal RGB format. Example:

pngoptimizercl -file:"myfile.png" -KeepBackgroundColor:F -BkColor:FF425A

== About KeepTextualData option ==

By default, PngOptimizerCL will remove any textual data information found in a PNG.
If the option is provided, the textual information found as tEXt chunks will be kept.
Note that other types of text chunks are currently not supported and will be removed (like iTXt chunks).

KeepTextualData can also receive an argument:

- Use KeepTextualData:R (or 0) to remove tXTt chunks (as if no option provided)
- Use KeepTextualData:K (or 1) to keep tXTt chunks
- Use KeepTextualData:F (or 2) to remove all tXTt chunks and force one, using a key/data pair provided
  with the ForcedTextKeyword and ForcedTextData options. Example:

pngoptimizercl -file:"myfile.png" -KeepTextualData:F -ForcedTextKeyword:Author -ForcedTextData:"Hadrien Nilsson"

== About KeepFrameControl option ==

With an APNG file, you can change the play speed by changing the fcTL chunk delay_num and delay_den:
- Use KeepFrameControl:K (or 1) to keep the fcTL chunk as-is (default argument)
- Use KeepFrameControl:F (or 2) with -ForcedDelayNumerator:XX and -ForcedDelayDenominator:YY.
  XX/YY being a fraction of a second. For example, -ForcedDelayNumerator:1 -ForcedDelayDenominator:30 means
  the animation will play at 30 frames per second.
